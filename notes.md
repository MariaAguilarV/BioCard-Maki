How to include bootstrap in my index.html??
Me star designing mobile first, because is the easiest and then figure out later how to put that
in a larger screen

getbootstrap.com
1. Copy bootstrapCDN css and paste it before my link to css
2. COpy the other code and paste it inside the body of my index.html

go to documentation -> grid
2 types of containers: Containers (live a blank space in the border, 144) and container-fluid (usually not use, full screen)
  Container helps to know how many columns we want to use

  <div class="col-4 orange">
      col 1
  </div>

  aca se especifica de cuenato quiero mi columna, en este caso 4

  <div class="col-12 col-md-6 orange">
      col 1
  </div>

  medium and above, quiero que sea de 6


  IMPORTANT:
  Have all your content before you start
  Throw all your content in a document
  then I design for mobile
  THen I design for web

  colors and borders are better with CSS, don't use bootstrap
