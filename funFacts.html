          <li><b>Nickname:</b> My friends call me Maki, but not because of sushi, it is a short way to say Maria del Carmen.</li>
          <li><b>Favorite holiday:</b> Christmas! This is best holiday ever! My family and I always spend this holiday together, we get ready since December 1st making all the house beautiful, buying presents for kids and celebrating the birht of Jesus. </li>
          <li><b>Favorite game:</b> Ligretto. This is an italian game that I play with my sister and my friends.Ligretto is a card game for two to twelve players. The aim of the game is to get rid of all your cards faster than all the other players by discarding them in the middle of the table. The fun fact is that, instead of taking turns, all players play simultaneously. </li>
          <li><b>Favorite people:</b> My family! I have a wonderful family, we are very closed to each other and give support whenever someone need it. I have one beautiful niece, who is my soulmate, and 3 awesome nephews! here, I'll leave you a picture of my family, but one member is missing, my little nephew, who has born just one month ago!</li>
