            I am an Informatics Engineer, graduated in 2015 from the Pontifical Catholic University of Perú (PUCP).
            <br>On 2014, I spent one semester in the University of Rochester, NY. As part of the studying abroad program I took courses from Computer Science. One of them was Principles of Human Computer Interactions and since then I am thrilled by how deeply related is the user experience with a good design.
            <br>One of the things I love about interactive design is that it’s for everyone who is using a product or service. People expect websites and apps to be designed well enough that they don’t have to think about how to use them. That’s the great thing – these days, folks are upset when a site or app doesn’t meet their needs; we assume that sites and apps should just work.
            <br>I want to envision how people experience the products and bring that vision to life in a way that feels inspired, refined and even magical. My next goal is to become an expert on Interactive Design and maximize the user experience.
